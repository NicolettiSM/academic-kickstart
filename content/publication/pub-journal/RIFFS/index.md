abstract: "In this paper we aim to reflect upon the human-machine relationship in creative contexts and, more precisely, on some of the limits that machines present when we take creativity into consideration. In particular, we want to raise some concerns about the possibility that machines can genuinely instantiate intelligence as we understand it (the thesis of strong artificial intelligence) and are therefore able to take our place as creative agents. However, even considering the more plausible positions regarding the potential abilities of artificial intelligence (e.g. machines’ ability to reproduce behaviours that seem intelligent: the thesis of weak artificial intelligence), we are convinced that there are still some discrepancies in comparing creativity between human beings and digital agents. After having argued against the plausibility of human-like intelligent (and creative) machines, we are going to present some actual cases of weak AIs in action, alongside some questions that – we argue – are surely more imminent and interesting than the science-fictional scenarios depicted by strong AIs supporters: should we underestimate the importance of having a body in the creation of music? And what can be said about our understanding of pleasure and meanings? And also, what role should we grant to all of those social aspects and values that are related to music and that define a large portion of the meaning of the music itself, especially in the field of popular music? To answer these questions, we will address four orders of issues concerning musical creation by referring to sociology of music, musical semiotics and embodied simulation. Thus, it will become evident that music is much more than just a sonic phenomenon, and this is something we should never disregard while trying to assess the role of creative machines."
