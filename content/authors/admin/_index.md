I am a PhD Candidate at the **University of Twente**, at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science (EEMCS), working in the <a href="https://www.utoday.nl/news/67696/erc-consolidator-grant-for-marielle-stoelinga">**ERC-funded**</a> Project <a href="https://www.utwente.nl/en/eemcs/fmt/research/projects/caesar/">**CAESAR**</a> with the goal of marrying the historically separated fields of safety and cybersecurity.

I hold a Bachelor's Degree in <a href="http://eng.dipafilo.unimi.it/ecm/home">Philosophy</a> from the University of Milan and a Master's Degree in <a href="http://filosofia.uniurb.it/">Philosophy of Information, Theory and Management of Knowledge</a> from the University of Urbino, where I worked extensively on malware and virus detection issues.
